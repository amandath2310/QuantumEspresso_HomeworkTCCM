# QuantumEspresso_HomeworkTCCM
The input/output files used for the development of the homework using the MoTe2 structure, are divided into the following folders:
- 2H-final: vc-relaxation, DOS and Bands calculation
- 1T-final: vc-relaxation, DOS and Bands calculation
The scripts used to plot the density of states and electronic band structure are also attached in the "Graphs" folder.
  
Note:
- "opt" for optimization calculation
- "scf" for self consisted field calculation
- "nscf" for non self consisted field calculation
- "MoTe2_bands" for band calculation
- "MoTe2_dos" for dos calculation
- "bands" and "dos" for final calculation of band and dos.
